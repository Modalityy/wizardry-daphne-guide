You can get new Adventurers by reversing Adventurer and Legendary Bones, acquired from chests, daily rewards, Jeweler purchases, missions and the Mausoleum. How do I get the Featured Adventurer? You can get a Featured Adventurer by reversing their bones, purchased from the Jeweler. You will need 100 Reversals for enough tokens to exchange directly for the Featured Adventurer. How many Gems to guarantee the Featured Legendary Adventurer? 18,200 Gems if you're buying 11 Featured Bones for 2000 Gems each time. This will give you 100 Tokens to purchase the Featured Adventurer from the Exchange. Which Bones should I buy? Featured Legendary Bones. Buying <code>Adventurer's Remains</code> is not recommended. When should I use <code>Adventurer Bones</code> and <code>Legendary Bones</code>? Up to you. You can use them to strengthen your party with new adventurers, Discipline, and Skill Inheritance, or save for when new Adventurers are added to the pool. What should I get with Guild Points? Gems and Adventurer's Bones. Do Tokens carry over to other banners? No. What is the difference between Gems of Org (Green) and Gems of Erin (Purple)? Purple Gems can only be obtained with real money, and are used to purchase Purple Legendary Bones and daily Skill Books. Green Gems can be obtained from daily rewards, purchases, and missions. Why does the Featured Legendary Adventurer have two banners? One banner uses Purple Legendary Bones which awards additional Featured Equipment when pulling the Featured Adventurer. Is Featured Equipment worth it? Not really. The random quality and grade make it risky. There are rare exceptions, such as the 3-hit Cuisinart Sword. What should I spend my Gems on? Legendary Adventurer Bones and Class Change scrolls. Which purchases have the best value? Experience and Class Remains packages have the most Gems per dollar. See Purchase Evaluation page for more information. Is there a Pity System? No. Is there a Spark System? Yes. Each pull on a Featured Adventurer Banner gives a token which can be used exchanged for the Featured Adventurer (100 Tokens), Featured Equipment, Skill Books, and other items. Will Featured Adventurers be added to the Permanent Banner? Drecom has announced that they will, but none have been added as of March 2025."},{"location":"frequently-asked-questions/#adventurers","title":"Adventurers","text":"Question Answer I got two copies of an adventurer and they have different stats.

At the time of writing this, Merging is only available to Lanavaille and Flut. When you merge the two styles, you get a single adventurer that has the option to swap styles. In addition, that adventurer gets a new passive skill called <code>Contiguous States of Mind</code> that results in a minor 1 point increase to a few substats.</p> <p>When a unit is merged, there are some things that carry over and some things that do not. All inherited skills learned by one style are shared with the other style, so you do not lose any skill inherits by swapping styles. For example, if your Standard Lanavaille has <code>Queen of War and Love</code> at level 3, and Wandering Princess Lanavaille has <code>Queen of War and Love</code> at level 1, the merged adventurer will retain the level 3 version. I do not know what happens if you merge an adventurer that has a level 3 version of the skill with an adventurer that has a level 2 version of the skill. I suspect the higher value would override the lower value instead of adding them together, but I have not confirmed this.</p> <p>Each style, however, has its own Discipline skill and non-inheritable Unique skill. Any Discipline levels that have been given to one style do not carry over to the other style. For example, if you have Standard Lanavaille at Discipline 3, then you switch to Wandering Princess Lanavaille at Discipline 1, the Standard Lanavaille Discipline 3 skills are not also given to Wandering Princess Lanavaille.</p> <p>According to in-game text, the merged adventurer also has the maximum number of bonus points across both styles. I haven't tested this, but in theory that means if you had 10 bonus points on Standard Lanavaille that you applied to Vitality and 6 bonus points for Wandering Princess Lanavaille that you applied to Strength, the merged adventurer would have 10 bonus points. I assume these 10 would remain applied to Vitality, but I have not confirmed this.</p> <p>Ultimately, there is no reason not to merge an adventurer when you have the opportunity, regardless of who the adventurer is. You'll have to make a decision at that point which style you prefer to use. A minor stat gain with either style is better than no stat gain with neither style.</p>"},{"location":"frequently-asked-questions/#what-are-character-duplicates-used-for","title":"What are character duplicates used for?","text":"<p>They can be used to:</p> <ol> <li>Increase a character's Discipline level</li> <li>Increase a character's unique skill level </li> <li>Inherit a character's inheritable unique skill to another character (or your MC) </li> <li>Dismiss for Grade Tags While dismissing a Legendary character seems scary, it's possible that for some characters, that will be the absolute best value of their duplicates due to the fact that dismissing a level 1 Legendary character that has not completed a grade-up exam will give you 1 No Grade Tag and 1 Iron Grade Tag.

The larger rectangular area will have a boss for you. Prepare accordingly. Also, check this map to avoid the poison tile paths.</p> <p></p> B6F -Map Killer- <p>Note</p> <p>The beginning fork may vary. Don't bother opening the wrong door where the corpse tells you. It's just spikes. The corpses will give you hints to get through the level. I believe the correct warp order is right, up, then right or left depending on the previous corpse warning. (The light/sun rises in the east and sets in the west.) Statue room puzzle requires you to restore the statue heads that match your party members according to the clue on the nearby dead body. This clue can change every time you enter this level. See answers in the FAQ. Saint shield quest is also completed here; do the second warp wrong and fight the mob.</p> <p></p> B7F -Amongst the Dead- <p>Note</p> <p>You will need to go through the poison floors every time UNLESS you reverse the stones on the next floor that create shortcuts. Make sure to do that. B8F description tells you which stones open which paths.  Albano will REALLY not like you here, unless YOU DO something correctly (second playthrough only). The camp here is important as you can't access the Harken on the next floor until you beat the final boss. </p> <p></p> B8F -Deepest Depths- <p>Note</p> <p>The four stones on this floor can be reversed to create new paths on B7F.  From the entry stairs, the closest two stones creates paths on B7F at X:21,Y:11 and X:12,Y:2 to reach the unreachable treasure chests. The third stone connects the entry room to the hallway with the Camp by adding a path on B7F at X:8,Y:14.  The fourth stone connects the hallway with the Camp to the hallway with the stairs down to floor 8 by adding a path on B7F at X:14,Y:15.  No, you must kill the boss to reach the harken. Yes, there are mimics now. They hurt, but good news, defending their p atk gives you a big opening for massive damage. Good luck on the boss, and hope your head won't fly. (It will if this will be your first playthrough.)</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/","title":"The Beginning Abyss - Requests","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#fresh-start","title":"Fresh Start","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#sweet-walnut-delivery","title":"Sweet Walnut Delivery","text":"Request <ul> <li>Talk to the Smirking Adventurer in the tavern  </li> <li>Go to Beginning Abyss -Entrance- and gather the Walnuts</li> </ul> Location"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#light-shield-material-collection","title":"Light Shield Material Collection","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to B1 of Beginning Abyss</li> </ul> Location"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#fragrant-plant-seed-delivery","title":"Fragrant Plant Seed Delivery","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to Inn  </li> <li>Go to B1 and find the herbs</li> </ul> Location <p>Note</p> <p>It's possible this is randomly in any small room</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#scrap-sabaton-collection","title":"Scrap Sabaton Collection","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to the Item shop to activate the request  </li> <li>Go to the guild and accept the quest  </li> <li>In B1 gather junk and turn in the request  </li> <li>Go back to the item shop to receive item</li> </ul>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#rhodium-delivery","title":"Rhodium Delivery","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to the blacksmith to activate this quest  </li> <li>Go to the guild and accept the request   </li> <li>Continue on until B6 then collect the 2 Rhodium  </li> <li>Turn in the request  </li> <li>Go back to the blacksmith</li> </ul> Locations Info <p>Follow Green for one and Blue for the other</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#minor-harken-unlocked","title":"Minor Harken Unlocked","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#death-stench-investigation","title":"Death Stench Investigation","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to B1 and defeat the Ambush</li> </ul> Location"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#donatos-redemption","title":"Donato\u2019s Redemption","text":"Request <ul> <li>Defeat the 6 goblin packs in B1</li> </ul> Location"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#despicable-trap","title":"Despicable Trap","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#abyssal-steel-delivery","title":"Abyssal Steel Delivery","text":"Request <ul> <li>Fight the enemies blocking the Ebonsteel on B4  </li> <li>Pick up the Ebonsteel from the sparkle on the ground</li> </ul> Location"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#knight-butcher-ent-proliferation","title":"Knight-Butcher Ent Proliferation","text":"Request <ul> <li>Defeat the 3 enemies on B3</li> </ul> Location"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#fluorescent-flower-delivery","title":"Fluorescent Flower Delivery","text":"Request <ul> <li>You will activate this request as part of the Albano Bondmate line  </li> <li>Go to the inn upon accepting the request  </li> <li>Go to B5 and kill the mimic to get the glowstone  </li> </ul> B5F Mimic Location <p>Note</p> <p>The chest does not appear on the map</p> <ul> <li>Go to B3 and find the 2 flowers</li> </ul> B3F Flower Locations <p></p> Alternate Locations <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>It is possible that there are other locations than the above two specified, so if neither of those maps work for you, you can check the bottom-right side or just explore everywhere!</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#treacherous-floor-traversal","title":"Treacherous Floor Traversal","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#relentless-massacre-rabbit","title":"Relentless Massacre Rabbit","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to B4 and fight the vorpal bunny 4 times</li> </ul> Locations Alternate Locations"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#grandchild-party-rescue","title":"Grandchild Party Rescue","text":"Request <ul> <li>Save Mel and her party on B5</li> </ul> Location"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#second-major-harken","title":"Second Major Harken","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#search-for-lambert","title":"Search for Lambert","text":"Request <ol> <li>Talk to Sophia in the tavern  </li> <li>Find Lambert on B7.

It will generally spam an AOE frontline attack, but can sometimes do a column attack. Very rarely, it will decide to basic attack. Every 4 turns, it will rebuff itself for another 4 turns. When it's about to die, it will buff itself with an accuracy buff and damage buff for 4 turns that isn't as strong as its usual buff. However, the attack buff does not stack with the other attack buff, but the accuracy buffs stack.</p> <p>Boss: Defensive Golem</p> <p>It will buff itself on turn 1 with invulnerability (it will take 0 damage permanently). It also has the same moveset as the Offensive Golem in which it spams an AOE frontline attack or a column attack. It occasionally uses basic attacks. Every 4 turns, it will rebuff itself with the invulnerability (despite it having no duration). When it's about to die, it will buff itself with an accuracy buff and damage buff that are very mild for 4 turns.</p> Saving the Dog and Adventurers <p>If you choose to save both the dog and adventurers at the same time, you will need to fight BOTH, and the invulnerability buff of the defensive golem applies to the offensive golem (but not the other way around for the offensive buff). If you choose to save only either one, you will still need to fight both golems, but one at a time instead.</p> Strategy <p>Frontline: Frontline preferably 3 Knights/Fighters/Priest (any combination) with 300+ DEF. Ideally they should have the skill Self-healing with a Divine Power Staff switch for bonus healing. It's also preferable to have entire inventories of Ultra Healing.</p> <p>Backline: Backline preferably 1 Priest, 1 opening-hitter DPS, 1 Ninja. Ninja and Priest are required, all 3 backline should have self-healing with a Divine Power switch if they're not healers. Bring as many SP and MP pots as possible. This can be a long battle.</p> <p>Strategy: If your team is fast enough, you have 1 turn to burn the defense golem for as much HP as possible in 1 turn. You need to use defense penetration skills or extremely high level skills, otherwise you will do nothing substantial. </p> <p>Once the golems buff, you must have the ninja use dissipation on the offensive golem. All units should defend at this point and wait for one of the golems to cause an opening. On average, the offensive golem hits for 200-250 to defending frontline without his damage buff.</p> <p>Once an opening is created, have your backline opening-hitter do their strongest move against the golem. Every 4 turns, the golems will rebuff. You can tell when they are about to rebuff when the offensive golem has 1 turn of accuracy buff left. At this time it is safe to not defend with frontline and use Self-healing or Potions. This will keep MP costs down, but if you don't have a lot of MP, then it's okay to run another priest/mage with heals. </p> <p>Repeat until both are dead. Use heals as often as possible. Makaltu might be worth using at low levels to reduce ur overall mp cost in the fight by a bit but it's not necessary, and you will die regardless if the offensive golem moves to the frontline and attacks with the damage buff up. </p> <p>The defensive golem will likely die first, and the offensive golem will actually remove its invulnerability buff once it reache's near death. Dissipation still removes the damage buff first. It will still have quite a bit of HP so continue the strategy and only attack when it has 1 turn of accuracy left.</p> Additional Notes <ul> <li>If you only save the dog, you get nothing but the stated gold in the request.</li> <li>The quest is not repeatable once the bondmate has been obtained (Unsure if this is intended or not)</li> </ul> Rewards <p>If you save both the dog and the adventurers, you will receive the bondmate \"Eugen and Bibi\" which is a void element bondmate with confusion tolerance.</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/3-guarda-fortress/requests/#emergency-occurrence","title":"Emergency Occurrence","text":"Requirements <p>Attained Guarda Fortress Abyss True Ending</p> <p>This request leads to a boss fight that is arguably more difficult than that of the average fight with the GWO of this abyss.</p> <ol> <li>After accepting the quest, head to Edge of Town to receive more information.</li> <li>Head to Zone 3 -Old Secret Passage B3F- and walk slightly north of the Harken.</li> </ol> Enemies <p>Enemies</p> <p></p> <p>Boss: Necrocore</p> <p>This boss will always act three times at the start of the fight.

Try not to use Light element adventurers, as all the damage done by the enemies are Dark. It's almost MANDATORY to have Assault guard level 1 on all the frontline (Not necessary if you have Undead Resistance and/or Dark Element).</p> <p>Backline:     Two priests are preferred, especially if at least one of them can cast mage skills (Kantios). They ideally should both have Madios LvL 3+ and Makaltu Lvl 3+. If you do not have a Knight in the frontline OR are using the Knight for DPS purposes only, you WILL need a knight SPECIFICALLY to cast Knight's Defense. Assault Guard is preferred on all the backline as well.</p> <p>The Knight casting Knight's Defense needs to be slower than all other party members, but still be around ~70 ASPD give or take a few to not be outsped later in the fight by the Necrocore. </p> <p>Generally speaking, you should try to have Undead Slayer gear for the boss if normal gear isn't doing enough damage.</p> <p>Strategy:     Essentially, this fight is a DPS race to see whether your team can kill the Necrocore before it wipes your team. The fight will ALWAYS start out as an Ambush, and as such, the Necrocore always gets a free hit on your party. He hits EXTREMELY hard and easily deals 500+ damage on an assault guarded frontline with 300+ defense. It's acceptable to restart if he does Spear Thrust instead of Zelos or Mazelos, as those are not affected by the attack buff he casts. Essentially you will be spamming Full Power Strike on Fighters OR Heavy Attack/Precision Strike/Armor Pierce LVL 3+ every turn on ONLY the Necrocore, as the fight will end once the Necrocore dies. Makaltu will help a lot with surviving the onslaught of damage every turn, as it's quite a lot EVEN with Knight's Defense. Two priests are preferred, as you often will need to cast Madios Lvl 3+ on both rows. When you do not need to heal, attempt to cast Kantios on the back row and then the front row. This will reduce the amount of damage you may take, as most of the basic enemies have Instant Kill moves or skills that deal a lot of AOE damage. It's also preferrable for the support adventurers to carry nourishing draught if you need more turns to deal with the Necrocore.</p> Additional Notes <ul> <li>If you die, you don't need to use any Flame of Resurrection as there is a Harken nearby, but you will still lose 5 fortitude on all allies.</li> <li>Dissipation does not work here very well, as the Necrocore can rebuff at any time.

The change to her unique skill from <code>Water Formation</code> to <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code> is arguably a downgrade. <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code> will give Flut a minor boost to her Magic Power and Defense, however losing the <code>Water Formation</code> buff could have implications later in the game if single element parties become more widespread.</p> <p>As of her release, <code>Water Formation</code> can already be utilized by having a back row of Flut, Alice, and either Philip or Viviana. If Alice was made into a mage, the <code>Water Formation</code> damage boost for her would already surpass the personal damage boost that Flut would gain from <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code>. This is arguably a negligible gain currently due to the lack of any difficult Fire-type content, however the moment that content gets released, <code>Water Formation</code> has the potential to be much more valuable than <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code>. Furthermore, <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code> is a boost when she has a two-handed staff equipped, which completely contrasts with one of her two possible classes. You'd currently never have one equipped if you changed her class to run her as a Warrior.</p> <p>As far as <code>Gift of Spell Genius</code> goes, this is another arguably downgrade to <code>Young Spell Prodigy</code> due to Gift no longer providing an increased Magic Power boost at higher Discipline levels.</p> <p>In terms of role competition, Flut is already surpassed by Mage Alice in terms of utility, so unless you're already running Flut in your party, there's nothing overly enticing about her Mage of the Silent Night kit that would make me consider adding her.</p> <p>Lastly, if you're interested in her strictly for her appearance, everyone will be getting a free <code>Remains of the Mage Praying on the Silent Night</code> bone on Day 6 of the Sacred Feast Special Supplies.</p> <p>Ultimately, this is the first banner the game has introduced that I recommend completely ignoring, as there is essentially zero incentive to use her over standard Flut.</p> <ul> <li>Pull if:<ul> <li>You really want to have more than a single copy of Mage of the Silent Night.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do not pull if:<ul> <li>You're okay waiting for your free bone on Day 6.</li> <li>You're 99+% of the player base.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"adventurers/general-adventurers/details/Flut/#duplicate-usage","title":"Duplicate Usage:","text":"<ul> <li>If you use her Mage of the Silent Night style<ul> <li>Inherit her standard style dupes to her own skill to increase its damage.</li> <li>Mage of the Silent Night dupes can either go towards Discipline or inherit.

Furthermore, she gains Attack Power with her Discipline levels, which is great.</p> <p>The passive damage boost from her Flickering Fang skill should be roughly 10%, which has the potential to be solid for her damage, particularly if we see more and more magical beasts as additional content gets released.

She is also a hybrid between a Fighter and a Mage, and compared to Iarumas, she actually has a better all around passive set. Having both Way of the Warrior and Way of the Mage means she has both a solid scaling damage multiplier, as well as a solid MP passive MP reduction for some of her spells.</p> <p>Coin of Power allows her to equip one-handed and two-handed swords, which pretty much cements her as a front line adventurer. In addition, it increases physical-oriented stats.</p> <p>True Words of Fire is a very unique spell. At a glance, it's HALITO that can apply two debuffs. Both of these debuffs will stack with other sources of the same debuff, but you'll want to keep in mind the debuff limit. This spell is going to take two of the three spots. One big unknown at this time is how exactly the level-based damage of this spell works. It will presumably hit harder than HALITO, but it's too soon to say how much harder, and will be something to keep an eye on. The formula for it appears to consider both Magic Power and Class Level when calculating its damage, but it's unclear if that class level component will continue to grow as levels increase past 60, or if that portion is based on a percentage of the current maximum level. One important thing to note is that True Words of Fire, like TZALIK, can be a sure hit, but it is unclear if this is intended or not.</p> <p>Comparing her to Iarumas, I personally think her kit is all around better. Iarumas has a better single target nuke, but Berkanan won't suffer from the same longevity issues and the fact that she gets access to Immortal Strike gives her a self-healing ability that deals damage, which is something mages lack. One thing that will need testing is if True Words of Fire is boosted by Way of the Warrior. Depending on how Way of the Warrior wording is interpreted, it could either boost the spell damage if she casts it on an enemy one row ahead, or it also might not boost it at all of spell damage is not considered close range damage. I'll update this once we're able to verify!</p> <p>Even though she doesn't have access to Full Power Strike, she does have access to Wild Strike which is a less efficient Major physical attack.</p> <p>Like Iarumas, gearing her might be a bit funky as she might want Magic Power if you want to keep True Words of Fire as a potential damage source (assuming it considers class level and Magic Power, not just the former), but she'll also want Attack Power for other skills and basic attacks in her physical kit.

First, to mention the elephant in the room, he is not an actual Samurai despite the belief many folks had that the Samurai class would release with him. Instead, a new precedent was set where the collab adventurers were released with their own unique classes. In this case, The <code>Mage of the Black Rod</code> class is a mix between a Fighter and a Mage, gaining some interesting versatility while losing some key passive skills. Notably, Iarumas does not have access to the damage multiplier provided by <code>Way of the Warrior</code>, nor does he have access to the MP cost reduction provided by <code>Way of the Mage</code>. He also does not have access to the new <code>Full Power Strike</code> skill, which means he's missing the Fighter's most efficient physical damage attack. Iarumas' assortment of skills and spells makes him a unique and versatile damage dealer that can provide some additional support.</p> <p>Mage of the Black Rod is a very unique passive skill, as its function changes based on whether Iarumas is in the front row or the back row. Since a component of this skill requires being in combat, we can't see exact numbers of the stat increase and some of them are harder to calculate, but rough early math seems to indicate that this skill provides a boost of 15 Attack Power. We haven't been able to verify if this is a static boost or a scaling percentage on that yet.</p> <p>His unique spell TZALIK has the potential to be extremely powerful. The fact that it deals major damage will put it above LA-spells in terms of magnitude, and its Magic Defense penetration will go ever farther to make it hit hard. The mana cost of 20 at base puts it roughly in line with a level 5 basic spell. This spell is a bit of a double edged sword, though. Like the CONES line, it's untyped which means it won't encounter any element type resistances. On the other hand, it won't deal weakness damage to anything. Furthermore, due to the lack of weakness damage, he won't be able to take advantage of the same type multiplier for having his element type match his attack's element type. One important thing to note is that this spell can deal sure hits, both when Iarumas casts it and when it's inherited to another adventurer, regardless of the weapon equipped. It is unclear at this time if this is intended functionality.</p> <p>His kit in general is interesting and it's a bit difficult to determine his optimal role. Here are a few considerations in general:</p> <ul> <li>He does not have Full Power Strike or Way of the Warrior, so since he's lacking a heavy physical attack, his physical damage role seems more supportive.</li> <li>He has the CONES line as well as TZALIK, which really emphasizes his magic damage, however his passive skill boosting stats while using 1h swords or staves puts him ideally in the front row with magic-based equipment, which is a potentially unique niche. He can exist in the back row, but that will effectively render his access to Follow-Up Attack and Counterattack irrelevant as sources of supplemental damage.</li> <li>He has Neutral typing, so he can benefit from Lanavaille, Alice, and Elise synergy buffs.</li> <li>He has no Way of the Mage, so he might become MP starved in long fights. Furthermore, there is currently no easy or convenient way to regain MP while in dungeons, which could negatively impact his longevity.</li> </ul> <p>The other big unknown is that we don't know if he will end up getting the Samurai class when that gets released in early Summer. We also don't know what future katanas will look like. His current role seems to be one of a front line magical damage dealer, which could be very fun and powerful, but he might have issues in longer dungeons or prolonged boss fights. Gearing him could also prove problematic since gearing for Magic Power is going to decrease his physical effectiveness, while gearing for Attack Power is going to decrease his magical effectiveness, and most of his current kit seems to support Magic Power being a focus.</p> <p>Duplicate usage is also going to be unique with him. Normally, I like to prioritize inherits over discipline for duplicates, however high levels of TZALIK could result in a currently unsustainable MP cost, while discipline would give him a low amount of extra Attack Power, Magic Power, SP, and MP. On the other hand, if you're intending to use TZALIK as a situational nuke, increasing the damage it deals could be very impactful, despite the added cost.</p> <p>Iarumas is not a bad adventurer by any means, he has a strong Neutral and Void typing, and his kit is quite unique.

Not only does she provide defensive capabilities, her ability to buff a Good/Neutral row can be very powerful, particularly if you have a Good/Neutral MC. A front row of Lanavaille - MC - Debra/Gerard is very common at the moment, and all three units would benefit from the increased damage.</p> <p>In addition to her battle prowess, Lanavaille's end of battle heal is extremely valuable early game. While the initial heal amount is only 12, increasing the inheritance level will boost the heal value up to stay competitive as you progress throughout the game. This heal is often potent enough to allow you to save your healer's MP while grinding/farming or progressing through the story. The heal won't provide any real value during boss fights, but her damage boost will.</p> <p>If you have an evil MC, however, her value drops significantly.</p> <p>The newly fixed skills for Wandering Lanavaille are quite interesting, as they provide some nice minor buffs without fundamentally changing the character itself. The ASPD boost on Valiant Righteousness is very minimal at 2 ASPD per slot, however it only considers the weapon and chest armor slots. This means at most, you'll see a 4 ASPD boost.</p> <p>The changes to her Discipline nice - you should never say no to more HP, and Critical Tolerance will help prevent instant death, which is always good.</p> <p>Neither of these skill changes are game-breaking by any means, so if you don't like Lanavaille as an adventurer or you prefer her standard style, you won't really be missing out on anything by skipping her.

This lets him fit well in the front row with Lana or in the back row with Alice and not mess up their row buffs. He also brings us one step closer to easily being able to run a full Good/Neutral or a full Evil/Neutral party while enabling Lana's or Alice's buffs for both rows.</p> <p>His Apostle of Breaking skill provides some nice resistances for himself and any adjacent dark allies. The weird thing about this is that as a priest, he's usually going to be in the back row, which can force you to decide between placing him in the middle to allow him to buff three dark allies, which prevents you from placing a mage in the middle to leverage their secret art. If you place him on an edge, he can only buff two allies. You can also place him in the front row, but the limitation there is that Priests have limited equipment options compared to other physical damage dealers and they have a reduced Strength to Attack Power modifier, which means he'll have overall lower attack and not be able to take full advantage of his own unique spell.</p> <p>His Prayer of Rebellion spell, in a vacuum, is very powerful since it provides both a powerful offensive buff and a conditionally useful defensive buff for three turns. As a row-wide attack power boost that can be targeted, it allows you to cast this on your front line in turn 1 and have that line start attacking on turn 1 with boosted attack power. No need to spend a turn casting Warrior's Battle Cry first.</p> <p>In practice, though, there are a few major limitations with it that make it less appealing. The first is that you can only apply three buffs at a time. You'll likely want to be using MACALDIA, which already takes up two slots, so the order you apply the two buffs is crucial. I haven't confirmed this myself, but apparently the Resistance buff ends up ahead of the Attack buff on the list, so if you want to keep the Attack Power, Accuracy, and Surety buffs from the combination of MACALDIA and Prayer of Rebellion, you MUST cast Prayer of Rebellion first, that way MACALDIA will knock the Resistance buff off the list. If Red Beard is your only buffer, this isn't really an issue however if you're using two buffers, you'll need to pay close attention to speed tuning so Red Beard always goes first, assuming you want to apply both buffs on the same turn.</p> <p>The magnitude of the Attack Power boost from Prayer of Rebellion seems to be comparable to, if not a bit lower than that of Warrior's Battle Cry at the same skill level, with Warrior's Battle Cry significantly easier to get a higher skill level of through inheritance. It is possible to stack Warrior's Battle Cry with Prayer of Rebellion, which can be great if you don't need the Surety or Accuracy from MACALDIA, but most people are probably not in that situation, so MACALDIA would likely still be more valuable to them.</p> <p>If inherited to a different adventurer, Prayer of Rebellion will see a reduction in magnitude of the buff as well as a 1 turn count reduction. This turn count reduction is less than ideal since that can mess with your buff rotation and force you to delay reapplying it if you don't want to knock an important buff off the list. If inherited to Alice or someone with her skill, the two will offset each other at level 1, resulting in the buff lasting 3 turns while other buffs would last 4 turns.</p> <p>He's a solid pass for me, personally.

While the magnitude is tricky to determine, increasing Surety is always good. The buff will always be active for her, and \"adjacent\" in this game means on either side, as well as in front or behind. This gives her a lot of versatility in terms of position placement. Right now, the prime targets for her buff are an Evil MC, Gerulf, and Milana. This actually enables us to run aa full Evil party that could consist of Evil MC, Rinne, and Gerulf in the front row, and Milana, Alice, and Adam in the back row. This party would have both rows buffed by Alice, Milana providing an additional damage buff to the Evil MC, and Rinne providing a Surety buff to Evil MC, herself, and Gerulf in the front.

It is a skill that deals untyped spell damage on an entire enemy row, which initially is pretty solid, but is made stronger by the fact that it bypasses the enemy Magic Defense AND is based on Attack Power instead of Magic Power. Based on the skill details, the Magic Defense bypass rate is increased based on skill level, so while this needs testing, it likely behaves in the same way that Precision Strike and Armor Pierce do, but targeting Magic Defense instead of Defense. This gives a fantastic way for Rinne to get around high defense enemies, and it also gives us one of our first row attacks based on Attack Power.

It's an evasion self-buff that also acts as a \"taunt\" with a counter-attack. While at first glance, this seems interesting, there are a few big caveats. First, when I say taunt, I mean the affliction that skills like Attract Hit and Defensive Provike apply, which makes it more likely for an enemy to target a specific adventurer. These afflictions are not a guarantee - they just increase the likelihood of single target attacks going to a specific adventurer.</p> <p>Second, there is no listed duration for the affliction, so I'm not entirely sure how long it lasts. Attract Hit and Defensive Provoke both last for 3 turns, so I suspect it aligns with that. Regardless of how long that lasts, early reports indicate that the counter attack only happens once per attack received, and only on the turn this is cast. I haven't confirmed this myself, but if that is the case, this would be a very costly skill to maintain, as regardless of how long the affliction lasts, you'll need to use the skill multiple turns in a row to get a single counterattack, and if she happens to get attacked multiple times in one turn, only the first attack receives the counterattack.</p> <p>In addition, as a Knight, she won't have any innate damage multipliers, such as Way of the Warrior, so even though the counterattack portion has a defense penetration component to it, it's very likely not going to be nearly as powerful as her simply defending and someone else hitting an Opening. It's a very unique skill in general, but I frankly don't see a reason to want to use the skill at all, since that time could be spent performing one of multiple other actions that would overall be more beneficial.</p> <p>One thing I'm unclear on is if her Black Beast Feint counter attack counts as a basic attack or a skill. If it is treated as a basic attack, it could have some potential when combined with Follow-Up Attack or if inherited to a Ninja, as it could potentially both help trigger the Ninja attack power boost on evade and critical hits.

Savia was born to a family bearing such a title.</p> <p>Her father was a stern and formal knight, always with poise. Her mother was a sincere knight, prudent in her preparation for combat.</p> <p>Young Savia was interested only in the valor of her parents. She was taken with her father's martial prowess, her mother's handling of her blade, and their unwavering forms, no matter how strong a blow they took.</p> <p>Savia soon took to imitating her parents. She deftly wielded a dagger that should have been too big for her still small hands, and she did not flinch when struck by the swords wielded by her brothers.</p> <p>And so, everyone believed that she would become a great knight.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/life-stories/Savia/#page-2","title":"Page 2","text":"<p>Like most beastfolk in the world, Savia was a free spirit. She did not want to be that great knight those around her expected her to become.</p> <p>She found it fun to carry on in the image of fighting she'd picked up from her parents. But the more Savia wielded her weapon as she wished, the more she clashed with her parents.</p> <p>Her father, who bade her serve the royal family and protect them with her life, and her mother, who admonished her to ready herself to fight invaders and take on the honor of knighthood, became so distant as to no longer be thought parents.</p> <p>Her father was angry, her mother was dismayed, and Savia doggedly rebelled. Her brothers, who had no martial talents and were only good at obeying their parents, shunned Savia.</p> <p>\"Those dogs have put leashes on themselves. Not me.\"</p> <p>Her family couldn't handle her and Savia turned her back on them. She didn't care about being lonely.

Sheathing her dagger, she turned to find a neatly dressed girl with starry eyes.</p> <p>\"Your sword is wonderfully free. Please teach me.\"</p> <p>Savia's eyes widened. Unlike her family and the others around her, this was the first time she had met someone who saw only her strength. Asking her name, the girl thought for a moment and gave the name Kiki. And so Savia had one more reason to visit the mountains.</p> <p>Kiki was quick enough, but lacked strength, and wielded her blade with a wavering hand. But she laughed, happy to be doing as she pleased.</p> <p>They commiserated, both hating the formality of their homes. They boasted to each other about how good they were at sneaking out without being caught. For Savia, Kiki was the only thing that mattered to her.</p> <p>But they knew that peace would not last.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/life-stories/Savia/#page-4","title":"Page 4","text":"<p>One night, the invaders came in an all-out attack. Savia's mother, who had not spoken to her for some time, ordered her to guard the road to the castle with her father.</p> <p>She was to stake her life in a place that had been decided, in a way that had been decided. It was the role of one born in a family of proud knights. But Savia flew from her home and ran in the direction opposite of her orders. For whenever Kiki spoke of home, her eyes always drifted up to the castle.</p> <p>She slipped her way through the fighting, ignoring the voices of her brothers, until she reached the castle. It was then that she heard Kiki's scream.</p> <p>Looking up, she saw an enemy soldier riding a winged dragon grab Kiki, who was about to leap from a balcony.</p> <p>\"We have the princess. With her as hostage, the royal family will surrender!\"</p> <p>Every part of her burned with rage. The only thing that mattered to her was about to be arbitrarily taken from her.

It is you who I will protect.\"</p> <p>Not because she was a knight, but because Savia wanted to. It didn't matter who Kiki was, she was a friend. That was reason enough for her to risk her life.</p> <p>The sounds of battle rang throughout the castle. There would be no allies to reinforce them. But the door was held tightly and there was no worry of it being breached. Savia continued to stand as a shield for her friend, slaughtering one enemy after another as they came from the balcony, throwing away broken weapons and taking them up from enemies.</p> <p>Eventually the invaders were quelled, and when the king opened the chamber door, the princess was standing among the corpses of countless enemy soldiers, weeping and clutching at Savia's lifeless body.</p> <p>For protecting the princess, the royal family praised Savia as a true knight.

When facing an enemy with 0 or extremely low defense, or when your adventurer has a very high amount of Attack Power coming from non-weapon sources, this isn't necessarily a bad assumption, but there are a few things to keep in mind.</p> <ol> <li>A large majority of the player base is not at that gear level, and it's very rare to be facing enemies with next-to-zero defense. The Greater Demon that spawns as part of the Lingering Scent request has ~100 defense, enemies with 50-75 defense are extremely common. In addition, slimes and clouds seem to have 150+ defense.</li> <li>Multiple hits come with a few trade-offs. Each hit in a multiple-hit attack rolls its Accuracy and Surety independently. If you're not at the point where you are hitting 100% of the time missing one out of two hits is effectively a 50% damage loss. If you're not at the point where you're landing Sure Hits 100% of the time, only having one Sure Hit land is effectively only a ~38% to 50% damage increase instead of the expected 75% to 100% damage increase.</li> <li>Battle mechanics such as hitting a sleeping enemy or an <code>Opening</code> only apply to one hit, so the second hit in a multi-hit attack cannot take advantage of the damage bonus.</li> <li>The passive skill <code>Follow-Up Attack</code> triggers on attack and not on hit, which effectively lets it make 2h Weapons hit for 2x damage and multi-hit weapons hit for 1.5x damage or even 1.3x damage (I'm looking at you, Blade Cuisinart).</li> <li><code>Strength+</code> is actually pretty solid. My level 50 MC has 62 STR as a Fighter. This nets an extra 56 Attack Power when using 2h Weapons. When combined with the higher base Attack Power, that gives you a much easier time getting past enemy defenses or increasing the gap between your adventurer's Attack Power and the enemy's defense, thus increasing your overall damage. This increase, particularly when you look at other damage multipliers, can end up outperforming the additional hits.</li> </ol> <p>With those points in mind, am I saying 2h Weapons are better than 1h Weapons? No, I won't ever make that blanket statement. I also won't say 1h Weapons are better than 2h Weapons. What I will do is outline a few areas where I think certain weapons really shine.</p> <ul> <li><code>Follow-Up Attack</code> builds. This skill is very powerful and can easily out-perform some active skills at high levels, while simultaneously saving your SP. You will get the most out of it with 2h Weapons.</li> <li>Turtle builds. In these builds, you generally want your front line to be in defensive mode, while your back line attacks from range. Bows and Spears can be great for this, as well as Daggers and 1h Swords from Thieves with <code>Sneak Attack</code>.</li> <li>When you are up against something with a very small amount of defense or you have extremely strong gear with lots of offensive modifiers (Attack Power, Surety, etc), 1h Swords are hard to beat. Getting multiple attacks in is very good, particularly if no hits miss and all hits are Sure Hits.</li> <li>Thieves that want to spam Precision Strike or Sneak Attack do very well with Daggers, 1h Swords, and Bows.</li> <li>High defense enemies can be overcome very easily with both 1h and 2h Axes.</li> <li>High evasion enemies can be overcome very easily with both 1h and 2h Maces.</li> <li>Front-line Knights with low accuracy can make solid use out of 1h Maces. In this role, they're much more focused on utility and potentially landing a stun than damage.</li> <li>Front-line Priests that have some turns free from healing or buffing can make decent use out of 1h Maces. They, like the Knights, can hopefully land some stuns during turns where they don't need to heal or buff.</li> </ul> <p>One other thing to keep in mind is that switching weapons in-combat doesn't cost anything. You can always pick a 1h or 2h weapon to use as your primary, then switch to something else when you face a high defense or high evasion enemy. Alternatively, if your main weapon is an Axe, switching to a Sword or Mace against very low defense enemies can net you a bit more damage.</p> <p>All weapon types are extremely viable and there ultimately isn't a \"best\" one. 1h Maces and 2h Swords do seem to get the short end of the stick a bit, but can still be very effective.</p>"},{"location":"appendices/wheel-causality/beginning-abyss/","title":"The Beginning

This is most likely to encourage people to use Iarumas's unique skill that paralyzes. Other sources are also more effective than usual but not guaranteed (Mimic Secretion, Thunder Strike, etc).</li> <li>The dragon can be spellbound, but it does not stop its roar or breath. However, it will be more inclined to use basic attacks that can be exploited for openings.</li> <li>Evasion helps mitigate a lot of physical moves the dragon does, but requires a large amount (possibly 200+ for Steel Grade).</li> <li>Water elemental weapons and spells help deal more damage to the dragon. Water armor helps resist the fire breath.</li> <li>Cortu can mitigate some damage from the breath and magic, as Iarumas suggests, but as the dragon can sometimes go twice in a turn with mixed damage, it may not be enough alone.</li> <li>If your team has enough damage, consider using Knight's Defense to mitigate damage if your team's gear is not specced to deal with the dragon specifically</li> <li>It's suggested to have two priests as the dragon can hit the entire team all at once, so having heals for both rows helps a lot.</li> <li>You need a minimum of 43 ASPD to outspeed the dragon at Steel Grade.</li> </ul> 2nd Run <ol> <li>Watch cutscene of Lulu looking for info.

This has not been 100% confirmed, as there is some very unique behavior to Openings. See the disclaimer below.</p> <p>It's currently unclear exactly how this fits in with skill usage, but it's either not linear or skill damage is factored into the formula in a unique way. For example, if you hit an Opening with a skill, you won't see 4x the damage of your skill damage - it will be less than that, however it will still be more than if you hit an Opening with your basic attack.</p> <p>The Opening damage multiplier does stack multiplicatively with a sure hit. For example, if you would normally hit an enemy for ~250 with a basic attack, you would hit an Opening for <code>250 * 4 = 1000</code> damage. If that basic attack happened to be a sure hit, you'd be hitting closer to <code>250 * 2 * 4 = 2000</code> damage. If you happened to get what I'm calling an Extreme Opening hit, you'd be looking at <code>250 * 7 = 1750</code> damage for a non-sure hit, and <code>250 * 2 * 7 = 3500</code> damage for a sure hit.</p> <p>From what I can tell, this Extreme Opening is random - I suspect an <code>x</code>% chance to get a regular Opening and a <code>1-x</code>% chance to get an Extreme Opening.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/damage-mechanics/#maximizing-damage-from-openings","title":"Maximizing Damage from Openings:","text":"<ul> <li>Use high-damage attacks, such as a two-handed weapon strike (e.g., axe or sword), or skills like <code>Heavy Attack</code> and <code>Precision Strike</code> to take full advantage of the multiplier.

It's fine - more stats are always good, and if you go as far as getting up to Discipline 9, you can get a hefty ~28 added to most stats (and potentially more to the featured stats). The problem I have is that the value per dupe spent on Discipline is relatively low.</p> <p>I consider there being three main breakpoints for Discipline:</p> <ol> <li>Discipline 1: This unlocks the passive skill, and while it doesn't make a massive tangible impact on performance, I personally hate having locked skills on adventurers I use</li> <li>Discipline 6: This maximizes the +2 stats per level rate and gives us roughly +16 stats for 8 dupes (9 copies total)</li> <li>Discipline 9: Might as well go all out</li> </ol> <p>An honorable mention goes to Disciplines 2 and 5, which are the last of the Disc levels where 1 Dupe = 1 Disc (albeit to get to 5, you do have to use 2 dupes for Disc 3).</p> <p>Alternatively, Skill Inheritance can have equivalent or better impact on overall party performance for a similar or lesser dupe cost, particularly when you consider that skills generally see a jump in effectiveness on odd levels. Discipline 3 takes 4 dupes to achieve.

I don't like locked skills.</li> <li>Additional duplicates - inherit to the MC or other adventurers OR get the featured Legendary's skill to an odd level (3 is a great target, 5 or 7 are good if you have a lot of dupes) for a noticeable damage boost</li> <li>Once I hit the skill levels I want on whatever adventurers I want to give it to, only then will I consider going for more Discipline levels</li> </ol>"},{"location":"mechanics/traits-and-stats/","title":"Trait Points and Stats","text":"<p>This is our current understanding of Traits and Stats and is subject to change as we get more information.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/traits-and-stats/#trait-points","title":"Trait Points","text":"<p>Trait Points are the core seven attributes that influence an adventurer's stats.
